Hotel Management System
Project Overview
The Hotel Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage room bookings and food orders for a hotel. The system enables hotel staff to perform room reservations, manage customer information, and take food orders with automatic price calculations. Data is persisted using file handling and Java serialization.

Features
Room Booking: Allows users to book available hotel rooms and assign them to guests.
Food Ordering: Users can place food orders based on a predefined menu and receive total price calculations.
Customer Management: The system stores customer information including room number and food orders.
Persistent Storage: Saves and loads data using Java serialization to ensure data persistence between sessions.
Technologies Used
Java: Core language used to develop the application.
Serialization: Used for storing and retrieving booking and food order data.
File I/O: Handles reading and writing customer, room, and order data.
OOP: Utilizes object-oriented programming principles to manage customers, rooms, and food orders.
Requirements
Java 8 or above should be installed on your system.
